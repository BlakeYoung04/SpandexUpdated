# FAQ

## **How do I use the batch game conversion?**
1. Use the dropdown menu to select the game version you want to convert your materials to.
2. Press the 'Batch Convert to Game' button and select the folder where all your materials and materialgraphs are.
3. Your materials should be converted now to whichever game you selected.


## **Why is my model white?**

Make sure that if you are using a materialgraph from one game, you change the path to the correct location in the other game.

Ex:

Spider-Man Remastered Materialgraph path: materialtemplates\legacy\legacy_hero_spiderman_detail_windy.materialgraph


Same path but for Miles Morales: required\materials\hero_spiderman_detail_windy.materialgraph


## **Why is my model still white?**

Make sure that you run batch conversion on all your materials for the specific game. Please don't try to change the game version and then press "Save Material as..." because it doesn't save the game version. That only works for batches.
